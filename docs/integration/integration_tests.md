# Integration Tests

## Main goal

The primary goal of integration testing is to verify how an application interacts with external systems. 
For example, is the REST controller properly configured? Does the Kafka listener work as expected? Are the SQL 
queries executed correctly? Integration tests for both incoming and outgoing adapters help provide answers 
to these questions.

## Main concepts

### Test Slices

As integration tests only verify the incoming and outgoing adapters, we don't need to start the entire application 
contextâ€”only the classes and configurations required for specific tests. This approach speeds up test execution. 
The Spring Boot framework provides multiple test slice annotations to help achieve this. 
[All available test slices can be found in the documentation.](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/appendix/test-auto-configuration/slices.html)

## Outgoing adapters

### Database adapters

![database adapter test diagram](db_adapter_test.png)

Integration tests for database adapters allow us to verify:

- If custom queries are correctly constructed and return the expected results.
- The accuracy of the Hibernate model and its mappings.
- The correctness of database migrations (for example, those performed using Flyway).

It is important to run these tests using the same type of database as is used in production. 
This can be easily achieved with the help of the [Testcontainers library](https://testcontainers.com/), 
which allows spinning up a real database instance (such as PostgreSQL) in a Docker container during test execution.

!!! note "Why not with in-memory db like H2?"

    While it may be tempting to use an in-memory database like H2 for tests because it is easy to set up, 
    this approach can lead to issues as the project grows. Eventually, you may need to use features that are available 
    in your production database but not supported by H2. This can result in inconsistent behavior and the need to add 
    workarounds or separate migrations just for test purposes. Such incompatibilities can lead to tests passing locally 
    but failing in production. In contrast, Testcontainers are also straightforward to configure and run quickly, 
    eliminating the need for H2.  

    However, in-memory databases can be a good option during the early stages of a project when the choice of a 
    production database has not yet been finalized and you want to delay this decision.


Below is an example of an integration test for a database adapter. This test checks whether an entity is correctly 
inserted into the database. The test runs against a real PostgreSQL instance provided by Testcontainers.

```java
class ParticipantPostgresAdapterTestIT extends PostgresTestIT {

    @Autowired private ReservationParticipantRepository repository;

    private ParticipantPostgresAdapter adapter;

    @BeforeEach
    void setup() {
        adapter = new ParticipantPostgresAdapter(repository);
    }

    @Test
    void shouldInsertParticipant() {
        // given
        ReservationParticipant participant = ReservationParticipantTestFactory.create();

        // when
        adapter.insert(participant);

        // then
        ReservationParticipantEntity savedParticipant =
                repository.findByIdentifier(IDENTIFIER).orElseThrow();
        assertThat(savedParticipant.getFirstName()).isEqualTo(FIRST_NAME);
        assertThat(savedParticipant.getSurname()).isEqualTo(SURNAME);

        StatisticAssertions.assertThat(statistics).hasInsertCount(1);
    }
}
```

And `PostgresTestIT` which is a template from postgres database adapters tests.

```java
@DataJpaTest
@AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = AutoConfigureTestDatabase.Replace.NONE)
@Testcontainers
abstract class PostgresTestIT {

    @Container
    protected static final PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgreSQLContainer =
            new PostgreSQLContainer<>(DockerImageName.parse("postgres:latest"));

    @DynamicPropertySource
    static void registerProperties(DynamicPropertyRegistry registry) {
        registry.add("spring.datasource.url", postgreSQLContainer::getJdbcUrl);
        registry.add("spring.datasource.username", postgreSQLContainer::getUsername);
        registry.add("spring.datasource.password", postgreSQLContainer::getPassword);
    }

    @Autowired private SessionFactory sessionFactory;

    protected Statistics statistics;

    @BeforeEach
    void enableStatistics() {
        statistics = sessionFactory.getStatistics();
        statistics.setStatisticsEnabled(true);
    }
}
```

This test also verifies Hibernate statistics to ensure that the entity is mapped and managed efficiently. 
Monitoring these statistics helps detect issues such as the [N+1 query problem](https://vladmihalcea.com/n-plus-1-query-problem/)
or other problems related to Hibernate entity configuration.

!!! note "Why data are not cleaned up after the test?"

    Since `@DataJpaTest` ensures that the entire test runs within a single transaction, all changes made during 
    the test are rolled back after the test completes. Therefore, manual cleanup is not necessary.

    However, in some cases, this behavior of `@DataJpaTest` may not be desirable. To disable transactional behavior 
    for a specific test, you can use the annotation `@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NOT_SUPPORTED)` to 
    suspend the transaction created by the `@DataJpaTest` annotation.
